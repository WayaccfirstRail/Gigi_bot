# Overview

This is a professional Telegram bot designed for content creators who monetize their content through Telegram Stars. The bot serves as a complete fan engagement and content management platform, allowing creators to sell media content, interact with fans through AI-style responses, and manage their community directly through Telegram chat without needing external tools or interfaces.

The bot provides a dual interface: fans can browse teasers, purchase content with Telegram Stars, and have natural conversations, while content creators get comprehensive admin controls for content management, user analytics, and automated interactions.

### 2. Get Your Telegram User ID
- Message @userinfobot on Telegram to get your **OWNER_ID** (your Telegram user ID number)

### 3. Add Secrets in Replit
- Go to the "Secrets" tab in your Replit environment (lock icon in sidebar)
- Add these secrets:
  - `BOT_TOKEN`: Your bot token from BotFather
  - `OWNER_ID`: Your Telegram user ID number

### 4. Restart the Application
Once you've added the secrets, the application will automatically restart and detect the new credentials.
